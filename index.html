                    <h2>Welcome</h2>
                    <p>The program committee is delighted to invite you to the 17th Workshop on Mobility in the Evolving Internet Architecture (MobiArch) 2022. 
					<br> The workshop will be held on the 21st of October 2022, in conjuction with <a
                            href="https://www.sigmobile.org/mobicom/2022/">MobiCom 2022</a></p>
                    <h2>Aim and Scope</h2>
                    <p>According to Cisco Annual Internet Report, over 70 percent of the global population will have mobile connectivity by 2023, 
                        while machine-to-machine (M2M) communications will account for half of the global connections. In addition, 
                        the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak accelerated the need for reliable broadband Internet and mobility support at scale.

                    <p>Accordingly, the last two decades have witnessed the continuous evolution of mobile network architectures to support 
                        the unprecedented growth in mobile data traffic and quality of service demands. Higher-throughput and lower-latency 5G networks, 
                        Network Function Virtualization, Network Slicing, Mobile Edge Computing, Open RAN, and RAN disaggregation are only a few 
                        of the research trends that promise to deliver a more reliable, faster, and secure mobile Internet experience.

                    <p>ACM MobiArch 2022 will continue to serve as a forum for discussing recent research trends and future directions gathered 
                        around all aspects of mobile communications technologies and mobile Internet architectures, such as system and radio access 
                        challenges that have to be faced to implement reliable, optimized, and scalable mobile networked systems.
