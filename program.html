				The emulated, software replica of the 5G physical network is referred to as the Digital Twin and it allows for continuous prototyping, testing, assuring and self-optimization of the living network. Hardly a new concept, Digital Twins have a history of prior usage in aeronautics, manufacturing and building design to help simulate complex systems. But for beyond-5G (B5G), it’s still a relatively recent development that’s unquestionably groundbreaking. Although a twin, in real life, does not always perform and respond in the same ways as its counterpart, this one does. That consistency allows continuous prototyping, modeling, and research and probably makes it one of the best, most reliable B5G R&D tutors ever. Through the Digital Twin’s multiple emulation processes, traffic and signal generation functions work in harmony to mirror the actual 5G network in every way. Consequently, the physical system’s behavior can be tested, analyzed, and then accurately predicted under a nearly infinite set of “what if” possibilities. Better yet, all of this can be accomplished quickly, at low cost and whenever needed.
				<br>
				In this talk, we will discuss the concept, architecture, and applications of Digital Twin for B5G networks. The realization of such a Digital Twin is a very challenging task due to its complexity and inter-dependency of multiple subsystems. Therefore, we will also layout a vision on how the community, academia and different industries can come together to create a scalable and reusable Digital Twin.

				Cyberattacks are constantly ravaging valuable data, wasting time and costly resources, and negatively affecting companies and institutions worldwide. Big, high-profile organizations have suffered the consequences of cyberattacks with a high impact on the organizations, their customers, collaborators, and society. WannaCry and other ransomware software are still a threat that affects computers, encrypts data, and demands ransom payments in cryptocurrency. Another example is sophisticated versions of Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks (DDoS attacks), launched from Internet-connected portable and mobile devices -- such as IP cameras, residential gateways, and baby monitors, that cause major Internet platforms and services to be unavailable to many users around the world. These examples highlight the power and potential of cyberattacks potentialized by mobility, revealing a constant improvement and sophistication in attacking strategies. For sure, cybersecurity is not anymore what it used to be; we are in the era of ubiquitous systems, and we expect more than 75 billion devices or smart things to be connected by 2025. How is academia addressing the sophistication of cyberattacks? Can we anticipate the next moves of attackers to protect our information assets? How could academia benefit from the data generated in the network to create security intelligence and prevent attacks? This talk intends to elicit a discussion around these questions and present an overview of correlated research developed by Dr. Nogueira’s research team and future directions in these topics.

            Internet services are assisting to an increased decentralization driven by needs, such as process efficiency, privacy-preservation, and energy reduction, and also driven by technological advancements such as virtualization, seamless computing, and integration of AI from the far Edge to the Cloud.

			Worldwide, the population is aging due to increasing life expectancy and decreasing fertility. The significant growth in older population presents many challenges to health and aged care services. Over the past two decades, the Internet of Things (IoT) has gained significant momentum and is widely regarded as an important technology to change the world in the coming decade. Indeed, IoT will play a critical role to improve productivity, operational effectiveness, decision making, and to identify new business service models for social and economic opportunities. Indeed, with the development of low-cost, unobtrusive IoT sensors, along with data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, there is now a significant opportunity to improve the wellbeing and quality of life particularly of our older population. In this presentation, we will overview some related research projects and also discuss several research directions.

              <td width="66%"><p class="text-justify"> Mobility support is a prominent utility service provided by cellular networks to mobile Internet. As the only large-scale wireless network with seamless wide-area mobility support, 5G/4G and its predecessor networks ensure always-connected experience for billions of mobile phones and tens of billions of things no matter where they are and where they go.  

 

In this talk, I would like to talk about technical challenges and progresses for 5G and beyond mobility. With advanced wireless techniques (e.g., wider spectrum, massive MIMO, small cells) and increasing demands (e.g., extreme mobility, 3D coverage, ultra-high availability), 5G mobility faces with not only new problems in emerging scenarios but also old problems which are deteriorated with the mitigation from 4G to 5G. I will first present our recent efforts to reveal and characterize the negative impacts of legacy mechanisms and policies for mobility support, and then discuss potential solutions and ongoing efforts in the community. There is no end for mobile network evolution, which pushes us to even revisit the fundamental limit of next-generation mobility support.   <br>

This talk will present an overall vision for a 6G system to be realized towards the end of this decade. The drivers, use cases and technological enablers for 6G will be discussed with the goal of mapping the journey to a richly connected, intelligent system that will further integrate computing and communications, both wireline and wireless, and become an indispensable foundation for society. </p></td>
