                    <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
                    <p>
                    ACM MobiArch has advanced to its 17th anniversary as one consolidated tradition for bringing together an important number of researchers and industry players working in different aspects of mobile communication technologies and mobile network architectures. 
                    The workshop will continue to serve as a forum for discussing recent research trends and future directions gathered around all aspects of mobile communication technologies and mobile Internet architectures, such as system and radio access challenges that have to be faced to implement reliable, optimized, and scalable mobile networked systems.</p>

                    <p>The workshop will also facilitate discussion of key unresolved challenges and emerging issues in high-frequency radio access techniques (including 5G mmWave, Wi-Fi, and terahertz communications), mobile network architectures (vehicle networks, wearables, and IoT), security aspects of mobile communications, machine learning and AI applications to wireless communications, network disaggregation, slicing, and Network Function Virtualization, as well as key challenges facing the wireless networking of the future.</p>

                    <p>The workshop solicits original, previously unpublished submissions covering network architectural issues and system design challenges for mobility in the evolving 
                    mobile Internet. </p>
